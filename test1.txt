What is synchronization in Selenium?

Synchronization has a very vital role to play in automation. Code execution and application need to be in sync to perform the operation. If the application slows down for any reasons like network, heavy load, etc then the code keeps on checking for the particular web element.
Synchronization issues occur when operations are performed on a web element that is not yet present in the DOM, or it is not a state to accept commands

How to achieve synchronization?
The WebDriver will wait for a specified implicit wait time and it will not try to find the element again during the specified time period. Once the specified time limit is crossed, the webDriver will try to search the element once again for one last time.

Difference between Abstract and Interface

An interface is a reference type in Java. It is similar to class. It is a collection of abstract methods. A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface.


Abstract class
Interface
1) Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
Interface can have only abstract methods. Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods also.
2) Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.
Interface supports multiple inheritance.
3) Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.
Interface has only static and final variables.
4) Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.
Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.
5) The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class.
The interface keyword is used to declare interface.

8) A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc.
Members of a Java interface are public by default.
9)Example:
public abstract class Shape{
public abstract void draw();
}
Example:
public interface Drawable{
void draw();

What is encapsulation?


1. -Encapsulation means wrapping data and coding into single unit..
2. -Technically Encapsulation,the variables or data of the class hidden from other class ,it can be accessed   through member function of its own class.
3. -Encapsulation mostly defined with getter and setter method.
1. Declaring instance variable of class as private so that it cannot be accessed directly by anyone from outside the class.
2. Provide the public setter and getter methods in the class to set/modify the value of variable.

Throw and Throws

1.The throw and throws are the concepts of exception handling in Java where the throw keyword throws the exception explicitly from a method or a block of code, whereas the throws keyword is used in the signature of the method.
2.The throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly. It can throw only one exception at a time.
3.The throws keyword can be used to declare multiple exceptions, separated by a comma. Whichever exception occurs, if matched with the declared ones, is thrown automatically then.
4.throw keyword cannot propagate checked exceptions. It is only used to propagate the unchecked Exceptions that are not checked using the throws keyword. throws keyword is used to propagate the checked Exceptions only. 

Throw:

try {
            // double x=3/0;
            throw new ArithmeticException();
        }

Throws:

 public static void writeToFile() throws Exception
    {
        BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(
            new FileWriter("myFile.txt"));
        bw.write("Test");
        bw.close();
    }
